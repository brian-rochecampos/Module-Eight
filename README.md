1.	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was solving in these projects involved analyzing data structures and algorithms. In Project One, the goal was to analyze the run-time of different data structures. Project Two focused on developing code that would sort and print a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order.

2.	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

To approach the problem, I conducted a thorough analysis of data structures and algorithms. I studied the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of various data structures, such as arrays and linked lists. By understanding the algorithms used in these data structures and their corresponding time and space complexities, I could evaluate their performance and suitability for different scenarios.

Data structures are important to understand because they provide efficient and organized ways of storing and manipulating data. By selecting the appropriate data structure, I can optimize my algorithms and improve program performance. Understanding data structures enables us to manage and access data effectively, which is essential for developing efficient and scalable software solutions.

3.	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

While working on these activities and projects, I encountered roadblocks such as understanding complex data structures and their associated algorithms. To overcome these challenges, I utilized additional learning resources, such as Stack Overflow, online tutorials, and Youtube. I also sought guidance from one of my peers to clarify my doubts. By persistently exploring and practicing different data structures and algorithms, I gradually overcame these obstacles and enhanced my understanding.

4.	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on these projects expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by emphasizing the importance of algorithmic efficiency and data structure selection. I learned that a well-designed algorithm with an appropriate data structure can significantly impact the performance and scalability of a program and has enabled me to make informed decisions when developing software solutions.

Additionally, my work on these projects enhanced my ability to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Writing clean and modular code, along with clear documentation improves code readability. These projects emphasized the importance of designing programs that are not only efficient but also maintainable and adaptable for future changes and enhancements.
